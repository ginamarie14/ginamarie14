### Hello! Â¡Hola! Salut ! OlÃ ! å¤§å®¶å¥½ ! ðŸ¤—

My name is Gina Marie, and I am a Web Developer. I am currently finishing a 6-month bootcamp in Full-Stack Web Development with the University of California Berkeley. I see web development as a medium to finding solutions, and I hope to transmit my passion for helping and making things pretty through this medium. âœ¨

Born and raised in NJ, I've had the opportunity to live in Paris, France, and San Luis PotosÃ­, Mexico. I love traveling, meeting new people, and learning about different cultures. I also love language learning! I speak English, Spanish, and French fluently, and I am conversational in Portuguese. I am currently working on my Mandarin.

Feel free to reach out whether it be to collaborate or just to chat!
